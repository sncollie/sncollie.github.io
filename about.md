		<p>This page is about me...Steve.  This is me:</P>
		<img src="images/steve.jpg">
		<p>I'm a Capricorn, I enjoy drinking, playing video games, and driving too fast.  But not at the same time.</p>
		<p>I have a BS in International Relations, but I've never left the country.<p>
		<p>I've been a PI, an Executive Assistant, and a Carpet-Cleaner.  I've interviewed with the CIA, almost joined the Navy as a pilot, and I've flown a Helicopter a few times.</p>
		<p>But most of my life I've worked in I.T.</p>
