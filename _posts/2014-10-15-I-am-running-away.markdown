#Week 2 (or how I stopped worrying and learned to love Jekyll)
Who the bloody hell comes up with these names anyway?
Anywho, Week 2 is full-steam ahead, and I'm still quite lost.  Fortunately, I think that's the way it's supposed to be.

I hope.

##FUN WITH HEADLINES!!!

Let's see if I can post images!

And yes, I'm aware that I have a picture of myself in a StarFleet Uniform, but I'm posting Star Wars images.

Bite me, I like both.
