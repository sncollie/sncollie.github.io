###Why "The Napping Man"?
When I was in High School, I had a tendancy to take naps.

All the time.

So, when my firends would call (pre-cell phone days), I would invariably be asleep.  My mom would tell them "He's napping right now."

It got so bad, my friends (who are musicians) wrote a song called "Steve the Napping Man"...and we eventually made a video.

Sadly, this was before YouTube, so I'm aware of no existing footage of said video.

Probably for the best
